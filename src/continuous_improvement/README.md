# Kalki OS Continuous Improvement Metrics Module

## Overview
This module provides a comprehensive framework for tracking and analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) across the Kalki OS development lifecycle. It integrates industry-standard metrics frameworks (SPACE, DORA, DX Core) with custom metrics tailored for AI, security, and system performance.

## Features
- Automated Data Collection: Scheduled collection of system and development metrics
- Trend Analysis: Historical tracking and visualization of key indicators
- Actionable Insights: Automated reporting with improvement recommendations
- Integration: Works with existing CI/CD and monitoring tools
- Customizable: Easy to extend with new metrics and data sources

## Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the metrics collection
python -m metrics.collect

# Generate reports
python -m metrics.report
```

## Core Metrics
- Delivery & Speed: Lead Time for Changes, Deployment Frequency, Change Failure Rate, Time to Restore Service
- Quality & Stability: Defect Density, Test Coverage, MTBF, MTTR
- AI/Avatar Metrics: Model accuracy, response time, avatar engagement
- Security Metrics: Threat detection rate, false positives, patch latency

## Usage
- Integrate with CI/CD for automated reporting
- Extend analyzers/ and collectors/ for new metrics
- Review generated reports in the reports/ directory
